## Hello! üëã Welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm [Patrick D'appollonio](https://www.patrickdap.com), I'm a Chilean üá®üá± Canadian üá®üá¶ and a Principal Engineer working at [Kubefirst](https://kubefirst.io). I work mostly with Go and Kubernetes in my day-to-day, and as such, you'll see a few tools below I've built over time to solve *personal itches*. You should also see some Rust code here and there. If any of the applications you see are valuable to you or have any feedback, please do not hesitate to create an issue in their respective repository, or message me on Twitter: [@marlex](https://twitter.com/marlex). I'm always looking forward to feedback!

If you want to know more about me, you can visit my [personal website](https://www.patrickdap.com) (some of the most recent articles I've written are listed below!), follow me on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/marlex) or add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickdappollonio/).

My personal favourite projects are üìå pinned below!
