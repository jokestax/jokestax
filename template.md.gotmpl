### Hello! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm [Patrick D'appollonio](https://www.patrickdap.com), I'm a Principal Engineer at [Kubefirst](https://kubefirst.io). I work mostly with Go and Kubernetes in my day-to-day, and as such, you'll see a few tools below I've built over time to solve *personal itches*. You should also see some Rust here and there. If you see them valuable or have any feedback, please do not hesitate to create an issue or message me on Twitter: [@marlex](https://twitter.com/marlex).

If you want to know more about me, you can visit my [personal website](https://www.patrickdap.com) (some of the most recent articles I've written are listed below!), follow me on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/marlex) or add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickdappollonio/).
