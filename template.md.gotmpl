## üåü Welcome to My GitHub World!

Hey there! I‚Äôm Rishi, a Junior Platform Engineer at [Kubefirst](https://kubefirst.io/), specializing in Go and Kubernetes. My journey includes an internship at [Graphene AI](https://grapheneai.com/) where I automated cloud infrastructure with Terraform, and a role at [IRIS NITK](https://iris.nitk.ac.in/hrms/) managing data center operations. I also contributed as Co-chair at the [Web Enthusiasts Club](https://webclub.nitk.ac.in/) in Systems and Security SIG.

Feel free to explore my work, and don‚Äôt hesitate to connect with me. Find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/RishixMonk) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrrishi373/).
